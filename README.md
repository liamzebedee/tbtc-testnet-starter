Developing with the BTC testnet can be quite slow:

 * difficulty can be very unpredictable.
 * sending/receiving transactions can take 10mins at least.
 * to make transactions, you need money from faucets.

This repo sets up:
 
 * a Bitcoin testnet using btcd.
 * a local ElectrumX server.
 * pre-funded Bitcoin accounts for funding tBTC deposits.
